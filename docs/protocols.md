# Metal-Air Battery: Fabrication and Optimization Protocol
This document outlines the step-by-step protocol used to develop a high-performance aluminum-air battery.

1. Materials Used

Electrodes:
ANODE
- Aluminum 5000 series sheet
CATHODE
- Activated carbon, carbon black, manganese dioxide (MnO₂)
- Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as binder
- Dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent
- Steel mesh as current collector

Electrolyte:
- Agarose powder (2.5% in water)
- Potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution (8 Molar)

Equipment:
- Weighing scale
- Glassware (beakers, petri dishes)
- Hot plate with magnetic stirrer
- Drying oven
- Safety equipment (gloves, goggles)

2. Cathode Preparation Protocol

1. Mix activated carbon (50%), carbon black (20%), and MnO₂ (10%) thoroughly.
2. Dissolve PVDF (20%) in DMF to prepare a viscous binder solution.
3. Combine the binder with the powder mix to create a uniform slurry.
4. Coat the slurry onto carbon cloth or nickel mesh, ensuring even thickness.
5. Dry the coated cathode in an oven at 60°C for 8–12 hours.

3. Gel Electrolyte Preparation

1. Heat 100 mL of distilled water and slowly dissolve 2.5 g of agarose.
2. Once fully melted, add potassium hydroxide solution to reach a final concentration of 8 M.
3. Stir until homogeneous and pour into a petri dish to set into a gel.
4. Once solidified, cut the gel into slabs for use as the electrolyte layer.

4. Battery Cell Assembly

1. Place the aluminum sheet as the anode on one side.
2. Insert the agarose-KOH gel slab as the electrolyte separator.
3. Add the prepared cathode with its current collector on the opposite side.
4. Press the three layers together to form a compact battery cell.
5. Secure the layers using a non-conductive clamp or housing.

5. Performance Testing

- Measure open circuit voltage (Ocv) and short circuit current (Isc).
- Connect different loads (e.g., LED, motor) and record voltage vs time.
- Log internal resistance, current density, and electrolyte stability.
## 7. Outcomes

- Achieved open circuit voltage of 1.4 V and short circuit current of 450 mA.
- Improved consistency and safety with the agarose gel-based system.
- Identified optimal PVDF-to-carbon ratio for stable discharge behavior.
