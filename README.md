Optimization and production of metal air battery using agarose gel based techniques
This project focuses on the research, optimization, and fabrication of a low-cost, high-efficiency aluminum-air battery using agarose gel-based electrolytes and PVDF-bound cathode materials. The project was developed as part of a Chem-E Car initiative and aims to explore sustainable energy alternatives for low-power applications.

ðŸ§ª Key Features

- Agarose Gel Electrolyte soaked in KOH solution for leak-free ionic conduction.
- Cathode Optimization using a composite of PVDF, MnOâ‚‚, activated carbon, and carbon black.
- Achieved:
- Open Circuit Voltage,Ocv = 1.4 V  
- Short Circuit Current, Isc = 450 mA
- Improved stability, current output, and reusability through surface treatment and gel consistency.
- Compact and stackable design suitable for educational and prototype-scale energy systems.
