# Chem-E Car Project â€“ Image Archive

This folder contains visual documentation of the Chem-E Car project, developed as part of a chemical engineering initiative to build a small-scale vehicle powered and stopped by chemical reactions. The Chem-E Car is designed to travel a specific distance while carrying a defined load, with no external power sources or electronic controls. The project explores clean and controlled energy generation using chemical principles, making it a showcase of innovation in sustainable micro-mobility.
