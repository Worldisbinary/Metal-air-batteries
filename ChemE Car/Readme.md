# Chem-E Car Project

This project focuses on the development of a chemically powered small-scale vehicle designed to participate in the AIChE Chem-E Car competition. The goal is to create a car that can travel a specified distance while carrying a defined load, powered and stopped solely through chemical reactions. The design uses an aluminum-air battery as the propulsion source and a precisely timed chemical reaction for braking. Extensive experimentation was conducted using Taguchiâ€™s method and orthogonal arrays to optimize the electrode compositions and reaction ratios. The project emphasizes low-cost, sustainable materials and practical chemical engineering principles.

The repository includes protocols for battery preparation, component assembly, and performance testing. Data collected from batch-wise trials includes discharge voltage, current, specific capacity, and reaction timings. Supporting documents such as optimization tables, material compositions, and result analysis are organized in Excel files for transparency and reproducibility. This project serves as an integrated demonstration of chemistry, engineering design, and data analysis for real-world application in energy and mobility.
